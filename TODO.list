- Ring Multiplication: 3 functions -> Mul, AddMul, SubMul

- Include: Remove Single FFT (fft.h)
- Benchmark: Remove Single FFT (CMakeLists.txt)
- Test: Remove Single FFT (CMakeLists.txt + TestFFT.cpp)
- Src: Remove Single FFT (CMakeLists.txt + fft)

- Try to reuse BatchedFFT objects. Constructing many BatchedFFT objects will slow down the program.
- Try to use: Streamed execution, enabling asynchronous computation and data movement (CuFFT)
  + cudaMemcpyAsync
  + cufftSetStream
  + cudaStreamSynchronize/cudaDeviceSynchronize

- Add 32 bit build mode in CMakeLists
